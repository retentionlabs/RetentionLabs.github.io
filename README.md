# RetentionLabs Website

This repository contains the official website for RetentionLabs, an open-source project group focused on researching and developing AI memory solutions.

## About RetentionLabs

RetentionLabs is dedicated to overcoming the context length limitations of Self-Attention mechanisms in large language models. Our mission is to enhance AI systems with better memory capabilities, creating more helpful, consistent, and personalized AI experiences.

## Projects
